## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/JohnComonitski/FootballTrackingDataGeneration.git
    ```

2. Move to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd FootballTrackingDataGeneration
    ```

3. Create and activate a Python
    [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).
    On GNU/Linux systems this is as easy as:

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    # Work inside the environment.
    ```

4. Install the Python dependencies
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Get a Roboflow API Key
    Create an account with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) and get an API key.

6. Create env.py

    ```shell
    touch env.py
    ```

7. Add your API Key to env.py

    ```python
    keys = {
        "roboflow_api" : "ROBOFLOW API KEY HERE"
    }
    ```
