# Football Tracking Data Generation
Convert football match footage into proffesional level player & ball tracking data utilizing [Roboflow's](https://roboflow.com/) machine learning and computer vision libraries. The goal of this project is to enable clubs at any level to turn their match footage into match tracking data and match event data they can use to step step their match analysis to the next level!

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/JohnComonitski/FootballTrackingDataGeneration.git
    ```

2. Move to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd FootballTrackingDataGeneration
    ```

3. Create and activate a Python
    [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).
    On GNU/Linux systems this is as easy as:

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    # Work inside the environment.
    ```
  > [!NOTE]
  > This project was built with Python 3.11


4. Install the Python dependencies
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  > [!NOTE]
  > **_requirements.txt_** includes commented out packages which utilize your GPU. If your machine has a GPU, I recommend you uncomment out those packages.

5. Get a Roboflow API Key
   
    Create an account with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) and get an API key.

6. Create env/keys.env

    ```shell
    touch env/keys.env
    ```

7. Add your API Key to env/keys.env

    ```
    ROBOFLOW_API=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

## Match Footage to Tracking Data Pipeline
...

### Training a Player Detection Model
The creation & training of a player detection model is performed by [train/train.ipynb](./train/train.ipynb). If you work through this notebook, you will have a player detection model capable of detecting players, balls and referees. Models will be saved to the [model](./model) directory. Once your model is trained, you are ready to start tracking match footage!

**Tips!**
- Training can take quite a long time. Depending on the resources available to your machine.
- If you are using a machine without a GPU, you may find faster training results using Google Collab and their (relatively) afforable GPU pricing.

### Tracking Match Footage
Tracking match footage is performed by [track/track.ipynb](./track/track.ipynb).

**How to Track Match Footage**
1. Copy the clip you would like to track to the [track/footage](./track/footage) directory.
2. Open [track/track.ipynb](./track/track.ipynb)
- If you want a tracking video output, set **_generate_video_** to **_1_** in the Configurations section.
```python
generate_video = 1
```
- If you want teams tracked, set **_track_teams_** to **_1_** in the Configurations section.
```python
track_teams = 1
```
- If you want results saved as a csv, set **_save_results_** to **_1_** in the Configurations section.
```python
save_results = 1
```
3. Run the notebook to track the footage.
> [!Output] 
> Once complete, results will be saved to [track/output](./track/output) directory.
